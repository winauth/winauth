    <description>QRCode Library is a .NET component that can be used to encode and decode QRCode. QRCode is a 2 dimensional bar code that originated in Japan. Nowadays it is widely used in a wide range of industries, e.g. for vehicle parts tracking and inventory management.

QR stands for �Quick Response�. It was created by the Japanese corporation Denso-Wave in 1994 and is aimed at decoding contents at high speed. Nowadays, QR Code is used in mobile phones to ease data entry.

QRCode can also be printed on a business card or shown on any display, which can then be captured by the mobile phone provided the mobile phone has the software to read QRCode.

QRCode Library provides functions to:

    Encode content into a QR Code image which can saved in JPEG, GIF, PNG, or BITMAP formats
    Decode a QR Code image

The library can be used in any .NET 3.5 Windows Application, ASP.NET web application or Windows Mobile device application.</description>
